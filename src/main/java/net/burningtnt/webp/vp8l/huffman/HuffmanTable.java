/**
 * Represents a single huffman tree as a table.
 * <p>
 * Decoding a symbol just involves reading bits from the input stream and using that read value to index into the
 * lookup table.
 * <p>
 * Code length and the corresponding symbol are packed into one array element (int).
 * This is done to avoid the overhead and the fragmentation over the whole heap involved with creating objects
 * of a custom class. The upper 16 bits of each element are the code length and lower 16 bits are the symbol.
 * <p>
 * The max allowed code length by the WEBP specification is 15, therefore this would mean the table needs to have
 * 2^15 elements. To keep a reasonable memory usage, instead the lookup table only directly holds symbols with code
 * length up to {@code LEVEL1_BITS} (Currently 8 bits). For longer codes the lookup table stores a reference to a
 * second level lookup table. This reference consists of an element with length as the max length of the level 2
 * table and value as the index of the table in the list of level 2 tables.
 * <p>
 * Reading bits from the input is done in the least significant bit first way (LSB) way, therefore the prefix of the
 * read value of length i is the lowest i bits in inverse order.
 * The lookup table is directly indexed by the {@code LEVEL1_BITS} next bits read from the input (i.e. the bits
 * corresponding to next code are inverse suffix of the read value/index).
 * So for a code length of l all values with the lowest l bits the same need to decode to the same symbol
 * regardless of the {@code (LEVEL1_BITS - l)} higher bits. So the lookup table needs to have the entry of this symbol
 * repeated every 2^(l + 1) spots starting from the bitwise inverse of the code.
